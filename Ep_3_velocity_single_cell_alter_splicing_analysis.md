# Single cell velocity

**Velocity** analysis of **alternative splicing** in scRNA-seq, especially for **alternative 5'splicing (A5SS)** and **3'splicing (A3SS)**.

 We used **Cellrank2** in this episode. **Cellrank2** is a multi-kernel framework to analyze cellular dynamics based on RNA velocity. Mostly based on **PseudotimeKernel** (80% weights) and **ConnetivityKernel** (20% weights) to construct the matrix. By the way, **0.8 : 0.2** is just in default.
